Title: Incidence and case fatality of acute myocardial infarction in Korea, 2011-2020.
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is particularly fatal condition. We evaluated the incidence and case fatality rates of AMI in Korea from 2011 to 2020.
Title: Incidence and Long-Term Outcomes of Acute Myocardial Infarction Among Survivors of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest.
Abstract: Despite the increasing long-term survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), the risk of subsequent acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains poorly understood. We aimed to determine the incidence, predictors, and long-term outcomes of AMI among survivors of OHCA.
Title: Takayasu's arteritis presenting as acute STEMI.
Abstract: An 18-year-old man with past medical history of secondary arterial hypertension diagnosed at age 15 presented with an abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that exhibited left renal artery stenosis.
Title: Association of Neighborhood-Level Marginalization With Health Care Use and Clinical Outcomes Following Hospital Discharge in Patients Who Underwent Coronary Catheterization for Acute Myocardial Infarction in a Single-Payer Health Care System.
Abstract: Canadian data suggest that patients of lower socioeconomic status with acute myocardial infarction receive less beneficial therapy and have worse clinical outcomes, raising questions regarding care disparities even in universal health care systems. We assessed the contemporary association of marginalization with clinical outcomes and health services use.
Title: Marijuana-induced ST-elevation myocardial infarction in adolescents and young adults: A case report and comprehensive review of literature.
Abstract: As per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) is reported to be 805,000 cases annually in the United States (US). Although commonly occurring in elderly individuals with underlying cardiovascular comorbidities or younger generations with familial predispositions serving as risk factors, it is extremely rare for an isolated event to occur in teenagers with a history of marijuana use. In this article, we report a rare case of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in a 19-year-old male with no past medical history that was attributed to marijuana use. This case report and review of literature depict a potential association between marijuana use and STEMI. We also highlight potential clinical implications to aid healthcare professionals in making an early diagnosis and achieving a timely management strategy.
Title: Percutaneous coronary intervention for chronic total occlusion of the left circumflex branch in mirror dextrocardia: a case report.
Abstract: Mirror dextrocardia (MDC) is a condition in which the heart is located in a mirror-image position on the right side of the chest compared to the normal position in individuals with physiological variations. Patients with MDC and chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the left circumflex branch (LCX) are extremely rare in clinical practice. The treatment of MDC-CTO-LCX differs significantly from patients without mirror dextrocardia and the same condition in terms of instrument selection and procedural techniques. In this article, we report a successful case of interventional treatment in a patient with MDC-CTO-LCX. We summarize the anatomical and electrocardiographic variations in patients with MDC-CTO-LCX, and discuss the selection of interventional instruments and techniques that can be useful for interventionists as well as the diagnostic and therapeutic considerations that can be helpful for clinical physicians.
Title: Association of systemic inflammation with shock severity, 30-day mortality, and therapy response in patients with cardiogenic shock.
Abstract: Mortality in cardiogenic shock (CS) remains high even when mechanical circulatory support (MCS) restores adequate circulation. To detect a potential contribution of systemic inflammation to shock severity, this study determined associations between C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations and outcomes in patients with CS.
Title: Patient-level explainable machine learning to predict major adverse cardiovascular events from SPECT MPI and CCTA imaging.
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has shown promise in improving the risk prediction in non-invasive cardiovascular imaging, including SPECT MPI and coronary CT angiography. However, most algorithms used remain black boxes to clinicians in how they compute their predictions. Furthermore, objective consideration of the multitude of available clinical data, along with the visual and quantitative assessments from CCTA and SPECT, are critical for optimal patient risk stratification. We aim to provide an explainable ML approach to predict MACE using clinical, CCTA, and SPECT data.
Title: Transient Ischemic Attack in a 22-Year-Old NCAA Division I Baseball Athlete: A Case Study.
Abstract: A healthy, 22-year-old, male NCAA Division I baseball shortstop was experiencing confusion, chest pain, and tightness during an off-season intersquad scrimmage. The patient did not have any significant medical history or mechanism of head injury. After initial evaluation from the athletic trainer, the patient's cognitive status began to quickly decline. The emergency action plan was put in place rapidly and referred the patient to the local emergency clinic.
Title: Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis and Pancreatic Cancer: A Rare Association.
Abstract: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) is a life-threatening and relatively rare condition that usually presents as a multisystem febrile illness. It is associated with excessive activation of the immune system and hypercytokinemia, leading to an unregulated aggregation of macrophages and lymphocytes. Here, we present the first likely case of HLH with metastatic pancreatic carcinoma being the underlying etiology.

Based on this information, please provide clinical decision support on how I might treat this patient. Note: I understand you're not a doctor.","Based on the patient's information and the provided articles, here is some clinical decision support for the treatment of this patient:

1. Given the patient's age, past heart attack, and heart disease, it is important to prioritize cardiovascular management and prevention strategies.

2. Assess the patient's current medication, particularly for any cardiovascular-related drugs such as antiplatelets, anticoagulants, or medications for hypertension. It is crucial to ensure that the patient is taking appropriate and effective medications to manage their cardiovascular conditions.

3. Evaluate the patient's risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including tobacco smoking. Given the unknown tobacco consumption status, encourage the patient to provide accurate information to assess the impact it may have on their cardiovascular health.

4. Consider the impact of social factors on the patient's cardiovascular health outcomes. The article titled ""Association of Neighborhood-Level Marginalization With Health Care Use and Clinical Outcomes Following Hospital Discharge in Patients Who Underwent Coronary Catheterization for Acute Myocardial Infarction in a Single-Payer Health Care System"" suggests that patients of lower socioeconomic status may receive less beneficial therapy and have worse clinical outcomes. Addressing any disparities in access to healthcare and providing appropriate support are important considerations.

5. Review the potential adverse effects of the patient's identified allergies (nickel and penicillins). Ensuring that the patient is not exposed to these allergens during their treatment is important for their overall well-being.

Remember, this clinical decision support is based on the provided information and articles. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional or cardiologist for a comprehensive evaluation and personalized management plan for this patient.","[{'title': 'Incidence and case fatality of acute myocardial infarction in Korea, 2011-2020.', 'abstract': 'Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is particularly fatal condition.
