Title: Development of a Cohort Analytics Tool for Monitoring Progression Patterns in Cardiovascular Diseases: Advanced Stochastic Modeling Approach.
Abstract: The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. CVDs are chronic, with complex progression patterns involving episodes of comorbidities and multimorbidities. When dealing with chronic diseases, physicians often adopt a ""watchful waiting"" strategy, and actions are postponed until information is available. Population-level transition probabilities and progression patterns can be revealed by applying time-variant stochastic modeling methods to longitudinal patient data from cohort studies. Inputs from CVD practitioners indicate that tools to generate and visualize cohort transition patterns have many impactful clinical applications. The resultant computational model can be embedded in digital decision support tools for clinicians. However, to date, no study has attempted to accomplish this for CVDs.
Title: Healthcare Resource Utilization Following Acute Myocardial Infarction Findings from RECORD-MI Registry: Healthcare Utilization after Myocardial Infarction.
Abstract: The contemporary healthcare resource utilization following an acute myocardial infarction (MI) is not well known.
Title: Comparative Effectiveness of Second-Line Antihyperglycemic Agents for Cardiovascular Outcomes: A Multinational, Federated Analysis of LEGEND-T2DM.
Abstract: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, their effectiveness relative to each other and other second-line antihyperglycemic agents is unknown, without any major ongoing head-to-head clinical trials.
Title: Pericardial Calcification: An Uncommon Case with Intraventricular Extension.
Abstract: An 80-year-old man presented to the cardiology outpatient clinic due to shortness of breath. His past medical history included alcohol intake, hypertension, inferior wall myocardial infarction (five years ago), an ischemic stroke, and permanent atrial fibrillation (diagnosed three years before the current examination). A physical exam revealed a decreased intensity of S1 and S2, irregular rate and rhythm, and no murmurs nor friction rub. X-rays, Computed Tomography, and echocardiography exhibited pericardial calcification, involving mostly the inferior wall and protruding into the left ventricle. A diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis due to pericardial calcification was established and considered idiopathic. Even when it may be related to ischemic heart disease, post-infarction pericarditis could explain how the calcification extended to adjacent territory perfused by the circumflex coronary artery. Combined imaging studies were crucial not only for identifying calcium deposits in the pericardium but also in assessing a patient inherently prone to co-existing and exacerbating conditions. Even though pericardiectomy allows for removal of the clinical manifestations of congestive pericarditis in the most symptomatic patients with pericardial calcification, among patients like ours, with tolerable symptoms, cardiologists should discuss the therapeutic options considering the patient's choices, potentially including a rehabilitation plan as part of non-pharmacological management.
Title: Reoperative approach after extra-anatomic ascending-to-descending aortic bypass graft.
Abstract: Extra-anatomic ascending-to-descending aortic bypass grafts have historically been utilized as a safe and effective solution for repairs of complex coarctation of the aorta. However, reports on reoperation in these patients remain rare. We present a case of an aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting in a patient with an extra-anatomic ascending-to-descending aortic bypass graft.
Title: Use of intraaortic balloon pump in cardiogenic shock patients.
Abstract: The relevance of the use of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) in cardiogenic shock (CS) has been discussed over the past years. The aim of this study is to describe a single-centre 10-year experience with IABP and analyse the risk factors for 30-day mortality.
Title: Enhancing neovascularization post-myocardial infarction through injectable hydrogel functionalized with endothelial-derived EVs.
Abstract: Over the past three decades, cell therapy development has fallen short of expectations, with many cellular sources demonstrating a 'Janus effect' and raising safety concerns. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), supported by advanced technologies, present a promising avenue in regenerative medicine, offering benefits such as immune tolerance and avoidance of negative aspects associated with cell transplants. Our previous research showcased enhanced and organized subcutaneous vascularization using three-dimensional bioprinted patches containing HUVEC-derived EVs in immunodeficient animal models. In this context, stress conditions on the cells of origin further boosted the EVs' neoangiogenic potential. Since neovascularization is the first regenerative target requiring restoration, the present study aims to complement our previous work by employing an injectable gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel functionalized with HUVEC-derived EVs in a pathological condition of acute myocardial infarction. This bioactive hydrogel resulted in reduced fibrosis, improved contractility, and promoted angiogenesis, showing promise in countering tissue deterioration and addressing vascular deficits. Moreover, the molecular characterization of EVs through miRNome and proteomic analyses further supports their potential as bio-additives for hydrogel functionalization. This cell-free approach mitigates immune rejection and oncogenic risks, offering innovative therapeutic advantages.
Title: An Unusual Presentation of Acute Severe Mitral Regurgitation.
Abstract: Mitral regurgitation (MR) results from retrograde blood flow from the left ventricle to the left atrium. Common etiologies of acute severe MR include papillary muscle rupture from myocardial infarction, leaflet perforation in infective endocarditis, chordal rupture (pop) in myxomatous valve disease, acute rheumatic fever with carditis, or functional MR due to cardiomyopathies, myocarditis or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Here, we present an unusual case of acute severe MR due to ruptured chordae tendineae likely secondary to degenerative valve disease. A 59-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and renal calculi was evaluated in the outpatient office for a urologic procedure. He was sent to the emergency room with left-sided chest pain, 6/10 in intensity, burning in nature, and non-radiating with no aggravating and relieving factors. He had nausea and vomiting for the past three days. He reported similar chest pain at rest and on exertion multiple times over the past year. He also had a chronic cough with no recent changes. His examination was unremarkable. Chest X-ray showed interstitial lung markings. Electrocardiography revealed an old right bundle branch block, but no ST/T-wave changes. He was admitted and treated for atypical pneumonia with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. The following morning, he complained of persistent chest pain 9/10 in intensity which improved with nitroglycerin. His examination revealed a new onset holosystolic murmur heard over the precordium. A two-dimensional echocardiogram showed a preserved ejection fraction of 55-60%, severe MR with eccentric jet, concerning for partially flail leaflet of the mitral valve. He was transferred to the university hospital for mitral valve replacement. Patients with acute rupture of chordae tendineae usually progress to severe mitral valve regurgitation. These patients usually present with pulmonary edema, signs of heart failure, and cardiogenic shock. Papillary muscle dysfunction, as well as partial or complete rupture of the mitral chordae can be detected as a new-onset holosystolic murmur and can be a crucial sign for early recognition. In our case, the patient developed a new holosystolic murmur on day two of admission which was recognized early, and prompt surgical intervention was performed.
Title: Excess Mortality and Loss of Life Expectancy After Myocardial Infarction: A Registry-Based Matched Cohort Study.
Abstract: The effect of myocardial infarction (MI) on life expectancy is difficult to study because the prevalence of MI hinders direct comparison with the life expectancy of the general population. We sought to assess this in relation to age, sex, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by comparing individuals with MI with matched comparators without previous MI.
Title: Night shift work and myocardial infarction in the UK Biobank.
Abstract: Shift work has become popular along with adverse effects such as disrupted biological rhythms, metabolic changes, sleep disorders and myocardial infarction. Studies have shown a link between myocardial infarction and shift work, but evidence is still lacking.

Based on this information, please provide clinical decision support on how I might treat this patient. Note: I understand you're not a doctor.","For the male patient aged 72 with a history of heart disease, a past heart attack, and current unknown smoking status, a comprehensive and individualized approach to management is necessary, considering the patient's medications, allergies, and medical history.

### 1. **Cardiovascular Risk Management:**
   - **Continued Monitoring and Management of Heart Disease:** Regular follow-up appointments should be scheduled to monitor his heart condition. Echocardiography, stress tests, and other diagnostic tools should be employed as necessary to assess the progression of the disease and guide treatment decisions.
   - **Blood Pressure and Lipid Control:** Ensure stringent monitoring and control of blood pressure and cholesterol levels to prevent further cardiovascular events. This may include the use of statins and antihypertensive medications, assuming no contraindications and careful consideration of potential drug interactions with his current unknown medication.

### 2. **Medication Review and Management:**
   - **Review Current Medication:** The patient's current medication listed as 'Unknown medication' needs to be reviewed to avoid drug interactions and to ensure optimal management of his heart condition. It's essential to verify adherence to medications and evaluate their effectiveness and side effects.
   - **Allergy Management:** Avoid any drugs containing penicillin due to his allergy. In cases where antibiotics are needed, alternatives such as macrolides, cephalosporins, or clindamycin might be considered, depending on the infection and resistance patterns.

### 3. **Lifestyle Adjustments:**
   - **Smoking Status Clarification and Cessation:** If the patient smokes, offering smoking cessation resources is crucial, as smoking significantly increases the risk of further heart attacks and other cardiovascular events.
   - **Diet and Exercise:** Encourage a heart-healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Moderate-intensity exercise, as tolerated and recommended by healthcare providers, can also benefit heart health.

### 4. **Screening for Other Conditions:**
   - Screening for diabetes, kidney disease, and peripheral artery disease, as these are common comorbidities with heart disease that can affect treatment options and outcomes.

### 5. **Use of Technology and Decision Support Tools:**
   - **Incorporate Digital Decision Support Tools:** As mentioned in the article about the development of cohort analytics for CVD, using advanced modeling tools can help predict disease progression and personalize treatment plans.

### 6. **Emergency Readiness:**
   - **Education on Recognizing Symptoms:** Educate the patient and caregivers on recognizing symptoms of a heart attack or worsening heart failure such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, or sudden dizziness, and when to seek immediate medical attention.

### 7. **Consideration of Newer Therapeutic Approaches:**
   - **Exploration of Advanced Therapies:** The study on injectable hydrogel functionalized with endothelial-derived EVs suggests evolving treatments that could be considered in clinical trials or future therapies for myocardial infarction recovery.

### 8. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments:**
   - Given the dynamic nature of heart disease, regular review of the treatment plan is essential, adjusting medications, lifestyle recommendations, and other interventions as needed to align with the latest evidence and the patient's health status.

This plan must be tailored by a healthcare provider after thorough assessment and in consultation with cardiology specialists. Regular monitoring and adjustments based on the patient's response to treatment and any new symptoms or complications are crucial to optimizing his health outcomes.","[{'title': 'Development of a Cohort Analytics Tool for Monitoring Progression Patterns in Cardiovascular Diseases: Advanced Stochastic Modeling Approach.', 'abstract': 'The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide.

A 59-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and renal calculi was evaluated in the outpatient office for a urologic procedure. He was sent to the emergency room with left-sided chest pain, 6/10 in intensity, burning in nature, and non-radiating with no aggravating and relieving factors. He had nausea and vomiting for the past three days. He reported similar chest pain at rest and on exertion multiple times over the past year. He also had a chronic cough with no recent changes. His examination was unremarkable. Chest X-ray showed interstitial lung markings. Electrocardiography revealed an old right bundle branch block, but no ST/T-wave changes. He was admitted and treated for atypical pneumonia with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. The following morning, he complained of persistent chest pain 9/10 in intensity which improved with nitroglycerin. His examination revealed a new onset holosystolic murmur heard over the precordium. A two-dimensional echocardiogram showed a preserved ejection fraction of 55-60%, severe MR with eccentric jet, concerning for partially flail leaflet of the mitral valve. He was transferred to the university hospital for mitral valve replacement. Patients with acute rupture of chordae tendineae usually progress to severe mitral valve regurgitation. These patients usually present with pulmonary edema, signs of heart failure, and cardiogenic shock. Papillary muscle dysfunction, as well as partial or complete rupture of the mitral chordae can be detected as a new-onset holosystolic murmur and can be a crucial sign for early recognition. In our case, the patient developed a new holosystolic murmur on day two of admission which was recognized early, and prompt surgical intervention was performed.'}, {'title': 'Excess Mortality and Loss of Life Expectancy After Myocardial Infarction: A Registry-Based Matched Cohort Study.', 'abstract': 'The effect of myocardial infarction (MI) on life expectancy is difficult to study because the prevalence of MI hinders direct comparison with the life expectancy of the general population.
